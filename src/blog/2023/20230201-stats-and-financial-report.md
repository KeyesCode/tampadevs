Since we started in September 2021, we've grown immensely as a community organization

We've helped over a dozen people get their first tech jobs. In fact, 3 of them work for the company I work for. We've also hosted our TADHacks hackathon last year with [12 different teams](https://www.tampadevs.com/blog/2022/20221016-tadhacks-tampa-winners/) competing as well. 

Check out the video here:

We've hosted a grand total of 27 events with 1903 RSVPs

We also have a job board application we've built in house, and it has about 1000 impressions since we started a few months ago too. Read this [post to learn more about it](https://www.tampadevs.com/blog/2022/20221030-new-job-board/)

## Expenditure Report

Here's a breakdown of how much we've spent since starting Tampa Devs back in September 2021

Most of our initial costs were startup costs, which ended up being really high. The actual overhead of running Tampa Devs is fairly low though

From September 2021 - February 2023, here's the breakdown in categories

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats7.png)

- TADHacks hackathon accounted for the vast majority of our funding
- Legal/Accounting was work for filing for nonprofit status, CPA work, and trademarks
- Merchandise is T-Shirts, Hats, and bandana cost. We sold some and gave some as promotional material
- Events accounted for a small amount, we had to pay for food occasionally whenever it wasn't donated in-kind
- Community Tools were for Meetup, Shopify, and GSuite primarily
- Marketing & Services - this encompassed designing the logo/sublogos, business cards & the design work, flyers, banners, and stickers

In total for the hackathon we spent ~$4500

## Incoming Financials

Charlton and I have been on the fence for the longest time asking for monetary support. Partially because we both make a decent living, so we mostly have been funding out of pocket since we started Tampa Devs

That being said, thank you for all the amazing support! We opened up an opencollective page last month, and we have over $1000/month being donated from awesome members 

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats11.png)

We made a little bit as well on Merchandise, but I mostly make the swag just for fun and sell it with a small margin

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats12.png)

We have a job board, it's only made a grand total of $4. We only charge $1 right now to post a job to protect against spam

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats13.png)

We're not getting any corporate sponsorship at the moment, although we have a business plan of action for supporting them though

## Required overhead expenditures

In terms of actual expenditures we need to run Tampa Devs, it's fairly low

Meetup costs us $560/year since we run two seperate accounts

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats15.png)

Food and venue costs varies a lot, it varies between $0 to $500 each

![](/_assets/img/blog/2023/stats16.png)

But we've been having HCC (Hillsborough Community County) be super awesome in granting their venue in kind over in Ybor

(Thank you Lynn for being awesome!!!)

## Closing Thoughts

This was a super long post but I wanted to give some insights of all the things going on in Tampa Devs right now

We're in the process of creating a budgeting roadmap, we'll most likely have one in by the career forum in March

But I want to put down what the overall goal and vision of Tampa Devs is to give better perspective of what we aim to do as a pending 501c3 nonprofit, as well as the community voice as a whole with Tampa Devs:

I think that's it for now. More notes to come in the future!

I want to leave some closing thoughts as well about how me and Charlton feel about this year. Spiderman from Marvel said it best:

"with great power comes great responsibility"
